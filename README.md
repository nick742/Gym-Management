#Gym-Management

My project is based on gym management system. my team has used php and html as a programming language,
and used ampps as a server.

1. User will sign up at our website and enter his/her details as given there.
2. There we have provided 2 options diet chart and work out.
3. As user will include his weight, height and necesary details agter sign in.
4. Then my website will automatically generate a diet chart and work out chart for specific user.
5. A user can also edit his/her profile.
